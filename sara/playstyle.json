    "description": "Kujou Sara's playstyle appears to be between between a DPS and a support, but in practice, all you have to do is equip her up like any other DPS. Her battle strategy consists of keeping a safe enough distance to shoot her arrows while also increasing the ATK of her comrades.\n\nA typical rotation for Sara would be something along the lines of:\n> Using Sara's Elemental Skill (E) to move away from enemies and then shoot a *charged shot* to activate her ATK buff\n> After receiving the buff, swapping to your main DPS carry and utilizing the buff to deal heavy damage should be your next move\n> Once the ATK buff wears off, you should swap back to Sara and use her Elemental Burst (Q) to deal even **more** damage.",
