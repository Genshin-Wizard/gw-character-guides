    "description": "Kujou Sara is an Electro Bow character usually played as a buffer for Electro characters. Her buff comes from her skill which gives flat ATK to the character it activates on. At C2 you need to use a fully charged aimed shot to activate her buff, but with C2 she doesn't to do that. Keep in mind that skipping her charged shot with C2 doesn't generate any energy.\n\nAlthough her main purpose in a lot of teams is as a buffer she still does a decent amount of damage in those teams. Therefore it is recommended to build damage stats after meeting her required Energy Recharge which vary from 180 to 230 Energy Recharge depending on the team.",
