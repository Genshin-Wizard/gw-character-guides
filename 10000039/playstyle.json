    "description": "Diona is a versatile and simple to play support with healing and shielding capabilities.\n\nShe is cheap to build but offers versatility in how she can support a team due to strong shielding and producing many cryo particles on her Hold Skill, and healing on her Burst.\n\nThis makes her a comfortable flex option. Her main uses are as a battery in cryo teams and as a shielder in other teams, in both cases it is recommended to use her Hold Skill.\n\nHer playstyle typically consists of doing one or two Hold Skills, Bursting, and then swapping off to another character.",
