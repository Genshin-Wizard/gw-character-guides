            "value": "Itto generally likes at least two other Geo party members on his team to provide him with energy to keep his Elemental Burst constantly available. This can be achieved through a Mono Geo configuration, with all 4 party members being Geo, or a Triple Geo configuration, where 3 out of 4 party members are Geo. Geo teammate options include Gorou (damage buffs), Zhongli (shielding and RES shred), Albedo (off-field damage) and Geo Traveler (CRIT Rate buff). All of them provide energy for Itto.\n\nAlthough Triple Geo at minimum is recommended, the fourth slot in this configuration is _extremely_ flexible. This can be attributed to the fact that Itto more or less already has a complete team with 3 Geo party members, so the fourth slot can be adjusted according to your needs based on the combat situation you're facing. Some options include Bennett (damage buffs and shield breaking; Itto typically struggles to deal with elemental shields on his own), Venti (crowd control) and Ganyu (off-field damage and shield breaking)."
