For QuickBloom or Hyperbloom compositions, her EM needs will vary based on how many Hyperblooms she can reliably trigger. For a rule of thumb, Stringless is good as long as she is the primary Hyperbloom trigger. "

Aggravate teams want to apply a ton of Electro, which maintains an invisible underlying Electro aura under the Catalyze aura. TLDR: Thundersoother is mostly up. Outside of Aggravate teams, the Electro aura will generally not be up consistently.\n\n__4 Gilded Dreams__\nAs this set provides a lot of EM, it is perfect for Hyperbloom teams where Fischl is the trigger. The EM it provides makes it quite valuable on Aggravate as well. "

This makes it decent in Aggravate and Hyperbloom teams, and its cooldown reduction can theoretically be used in niche teams to shorten rotations but is mostly useless. "
