( most common when Fischl is run in the flex slot of vape teams ) \n\n__Prototype Crescent__ \nF2P option which performs rather well at high refinements. However, this assumes players will go out of their way to proc the weapon\u2019s passive and snapshot it unto Oz. Should players not want to deal with a high-maintenance weapon, it is best to look for other weapon options instead. \n** **"

However, the damage gained is rarely worthwhile. Thus, players should not farm specifically for the 4-set bonus on Fischl when 2-piece options perform competitively.\n\n__4 TotM__ \nAn artifact set that, although can be better for certain team compositions owing to the high buff-uptime she provides, is not generally worth recommending as her personal damage suffers significantly when running this 4-set bonus. Unless hyperinvesting into one\u2019s Fischl, it is best to drop farming for this artifact set entirely. "
