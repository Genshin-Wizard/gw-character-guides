However, the damage gained is not worth farming this 4-pc set over 2-piece options.\n\n__4 TotM__ \nAn artifact set that may be useful in certain teams as Fischl can maintain almost 100% uptime of the 4-set. However this set lowers her personal damage, and since the domain that drops the set is not useful to most characters, it is not recommended to farm this set."
