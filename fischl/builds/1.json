Thus, it is best to check with the Energy Recharge Calculator to find out her ER requirements in player\u2019s specific team compositions.\n\n**Niche Artifact sets:**\n__4 Thundersoother__\nStrong option when playing Fischl in most team compositions where electro aura is maintained. However, the damage gained is not worth farming this 4-pc set over 2-piece options.\n\n__4 TotM__\nAn artifact set that may be useful in certain teams as Fischl can maintain almost 100% uptime of the 4-set effect. However, this set lowers her personal damage and is in a domain that is not useful for most characters, thus why it is not recommended for players to farm this set."
