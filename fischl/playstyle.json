    "description": "The primary purpose of Fischl is to place Oz and kite rings around crowds. This is one of the characters who is inherently squishy and can be killed by a monster's basic combination. Moving and kiting back and forth is essential when playing a carry Fischl.\n\nIf you wish to play a support Fischl, you need drop Oz and swap to a carry, then utilize the overwhelm damage to build higher damage for basic abilities.\n\n**Additional Skill Tip**\n> Animation Cancelling. Mastering this technique plays a huge role in dealing the maximum amount of damage as you can with Fischl. Once you pick this skill up, you'll be surprised by how much damage you've actually been missing out on all this time.",
