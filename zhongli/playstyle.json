    "description": "Zhongli is a unit that serves 1 primary purpose, negating dmg via his shielding. Because of this and his Res Shredding, Zhongli easily fits into any team. This doesn't mean he doesn't have better team comps though as he primarily fits best into teams that need to do their full combo like Yoimiya, can utilize him to also trigger Geo resonance, or don't have acces to good other shielding/healing options like Diona or Kokomi.\n\nThe only issue with Zhongli is his dmg or lack thereof to be specific. Due to this you're typically only swapping to him to refresh his shield and then swapping out to your other characters. His Burst can be useful at times but generally results in a DPS loss due the length of the animation compared to the Dmg output. If you don't need his petrification then you generally don't want to use it as it comes up.\n\nDue to Zhongli's design his rotations are mostly just:\n> Swap to Zhongli to use his Elemental Skill (E)\n> Swap to your DPS characters to utilize your invulnerability\n\nHaving c2 can change this though as that will allow his burst to cast his Shield which would be utilized over his Hold ES when available due to better dmg output.
