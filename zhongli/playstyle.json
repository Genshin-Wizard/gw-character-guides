    "description": "Zhongli's flexibility is one of the aspects that contribute to his value as a unit, as he has several various build pathways and playstyles available to him, as well as good slot in potential in most team compositions.\n\nZhongli is primarily used for his infamous shielding capabilities, it is recommended to use Zhongli as a Support character, depending on the composition of your team, the type of Support you're looking for from Zhongli may differ.\n\nOne ideal rotation for Zhongli is:\n> Swap to Zhongli to use his Elemental Skill (E)\n> If you have Zhongli's Elemental Burst (Q), use that as well to not only crystalize your enemies, but to provide a setting for your DPS carries to do their work\n> Swap to your characters with the newly activated buff obtained from Zhongli's Elemental Skill and go absolutely berserk on the battlefield.",
