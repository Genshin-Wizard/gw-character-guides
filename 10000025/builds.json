Not recommended for non-C6 Xingqiu.\n\n__Favonius Sword__ \nThis weapon has a very high Energy Recharge substat at 61.3%, it also sports the benefit of being able to battery your entire team, and is a powerful option even at refinement level 1.\n\n__R3+ Sacrificial Sword__ This weapon has the same high Energy Recharge substat as Favonius Sword, but it's passive skill lowers Xingqiu's energy needs and is better for his personal damage. However this weapon does have the drawback of desynching rotations since Xingqiu has a very long skill cooldown at 21s."
