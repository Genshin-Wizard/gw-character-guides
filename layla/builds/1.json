Can be tricky to trigger since Key cannot build stacks off-field requiring Layla to be on-field when her stars fire off to trigger the team buff.\n\n__Primordial Jade Cutter__\nGreat weapon for Layla assuming you're building into her Dmg. Can easily take care of Layla's Crit Rate needs by itself while also giving her a bit more HP."
