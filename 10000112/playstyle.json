    "description": "Escoffier reduces the Hydro and Cryo Resistance of enemies, provides Off-field Damage, and healing. The Resistance reduction is 5%/10%/15%/ 55%, increasing depending on the number of Cryo or Hydro characters on the team. This means running only Hydro or Cryo characters is strongly recommended, resulting in a Freeze archetype. \n\nEscoffier best pairs with Furina, with an on-field Cryo or Hydro DPS. Most rotations should start with Furina’s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst, then Escoffier’s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst, beginning the off-field Cryo and Hydro Damage, then using her healing for Furina’s Fanfare stacks. After this, the Cryo or Hydro on-field DPS should use their skills or normal attacks. If Shenhe is in the team, they should go before the DPS.\n\nIn a Melt team, Escoffier provides much less debuffing, but still provides off-field Elemental Application and damage. In these teams, Mavuika or Arlecchino’s Elemental Skills should go before Escoffier’s. After this, supports like Bennett, Xilonen, Citlali, Kazuha, Yelan or Xingqiu should use their Elemental Skills or Elemental Bursts before the Pyro DPS is switched back on. In all teams, Furina should go before Escoffier’s Elemental Burst.",
