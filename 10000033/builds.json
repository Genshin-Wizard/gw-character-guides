Effect helps grouping and the main stat helps your Crit Rate needs.\n\n__Blackcliff, Mouun's Moon, Prototype Crescent, Rust, Stringless__\nAlternative F2P options depending on what you have available. Dmg is comparable between these. "

If you plan to use Childe on-field during his downtime you will also want to level his Normals to help his Charged Shot dmg. \n\nChilde's Artifacts:\nYou can use 4 piece Heart of Depth, 2 piece HoD with Atk% or Noblesse, or 4 piece Shimenawa's as they are roughly the same dmg output although Shimenawa will have a higher ER requirement to comfortably cycle.
