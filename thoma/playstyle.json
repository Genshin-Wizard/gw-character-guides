    "description": "Thoma works best as a Pyro shielder/support. His Elemental Skill and Burst form a transparent red shield around the active character, blocking incoming Pyro DMG and inflicting it on opponents.\n\nTo begin, the Housekeeper's Elemental Skill Burning Blessing of the Kamisato Clan is a blazing barrier that scales off of Thoma's maximum HP. When Thoma is struck, the barrier is reinforced and stacks. Thoma's Elemental Burst Crimson Ooyoroi, on the other hand, delivers AoE Pyro DMG and summons another shield akin to Xingqui's Rainswords.\n\nA solid rotation for a team comp containing Thoma would be something along the lines of:\n> Use Elemental Skill (E) until you have enough energy for a shield\n> Switch to your DPS carry with the activated shield\n> Swap back to Thoma before the shield wears off or breaks, and use his Elemental Burst (Q) to prolong the duration of Thoma's shield",
