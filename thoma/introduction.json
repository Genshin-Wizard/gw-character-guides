    "description": "The housekeeper of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, and a well-known \"fixer\" in Inazuma.\nFriendly and approachable, Thoma fits in with the crowd easily wherever he is.\nAt first glance, he seems to be a very easygoing person, but he is in fact very responsible. He has an extraordinarily serious side, be it in his work or his interpersonal communications.",
