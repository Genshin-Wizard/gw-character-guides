            "value": "Cyno has access to a plethora of **Electro flexes**. He benefits from units who have **lower field time requirements\u2014as to not compete with his own**; and **abilities that have some sort of off-field presence**, whether it be Damage, Energy Particles generation or Healing. Examples being: **Fischl, Kuki, Beidou, Yae, and Dori**.\n\nDendro being a novelty means **Dendro flexes** are scarce. Thankfully, between the characters readily available, Cyno is able to synergize with both the **Dendro Traveler** and **Collei**, who are also **free units**.\n\n**Hydro flexes** include **Xingqiu, Yelan, Kokomi and Barbara**.\n\n**Anemo flexes** can be picked up for their grouping/buffing/healing capabilities\u2014**Kazuha, Sucrose, Heizou, Sayu, Jean, Anemo Traveler**."
