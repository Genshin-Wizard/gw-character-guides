    "description": "Raiden's primary role is to create energy for the team in most situations. She can also become an extraordinary hypercarry with more investment in her cons and weapon but her playstyle stays consistent regardless as it just changes what units are used with her.\n\nHer Elemental Skill boosts the Burst Dmg of all allies on the team and has infinite uptime as long as you're getting Raiden in to refresh it every 25 seconds.\n\nRaiden's Elemental Burst is obviously her main draw though as it turns her into a Electro Dmg dealing sword unit with massive energy production and solid dmg. This is empowered by her Resolve stacks which are granted when allies use energy by casting their Bursts. Important to ensure she has the most stacks possible before activating her own Burst.\n\nWith all that in mind, you should generally use Raiden in the following rotation:\n\n> Use Raiden's Elemental Skill (E)\n> Activate any Elemental Bursts (Q) you have available\n> Activate Raiden's Elemental Burst (Q).\n> **Repeat.**\n\nThere are many combo options available to Raiden during her burst but the general recommendation is N3C which means 3 normal attacks, 1 charged attack, repeat. This as well as other options are covered in more detail in the Keqing Mains article linked below. ",
