    "description": "Raiden's Elemental Skill (E) buffs all Elemental Bursts (Q) which in turn give Raiden Resolve stacks that buff her Burst. Raiden's Burst will then restore energy to the entire party to repeat the process. Therefore, you should generally use Raiden in the following rotation: \n\n> Use Raiden's Elemental Skill (E)\n> Activate any Elemental Bursts (Q) you have available\n> Activate Raiden's Elemental Burst (Q).\n> **Repeat.**",
