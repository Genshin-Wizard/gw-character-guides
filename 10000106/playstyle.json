    "description": "Mavuika is a dual-carry character with two main playstyles: on-field DPS and off-field Pyro applicator/damage buffer. Tapping her Skill summons an armament that follows your active character, dealing damage and applying Pyro. Holding the Skill button makes Mavuika hop onto her motorcycle, granting Pyro infusion and enabling her on-field DPS playstyle.\n\nHer Burst deals massive damage, enhances her motorcycle attacks, and provides a damage bonus to your active character.\n\nAs an off-field Pyro applicator, Mavuika offers a quality-of-life improvement over Xiangling, whose high Energy Recharge requirements can become an issue without Bennett. This makes Mavuika a solid alternative for teams like Mualani Vape, Clorinde Overload, Wriothesley Melt, and more.\n\nAs an on-field DPS, Mavuika's strength is comparable to top-tier carries. However, her Burst doesn’t consume Energy; instead, it requires \"Fighting Spirit,\" which can be accumulated in two ways:\n• Spending Nightsoul points (1:1 ratio)\n• Your active character using Normal Attacks (1.5 every 0.1s, though less efficient than the first method)\n\nMavuika can store up to 200 Fighting Spirit, but her Burst becomes available once she reaches 100. Because of this, she heavily relies on fast Nightsoul point consumption to charge her Burst quickly—best achieved with characters like Xilonen, Citlali, or Ororon.\n\nHer two main playstyles are Melt and Vaporize. Melt deals slightly more damage, while Vaporize is more consistent due to reverse Vape mechanics.",
