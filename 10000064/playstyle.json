    "description": "Yun Jin is an excellent Normal Attack support. She provides considerable Bonus Flat DMG to Normal Attacks, making her a viable option for most characters who deal considerable damage with their Normal Attacks.\n\nYun Jin will switch in to cast her Elemental Skill and Burst, then switch out quickly, generally to the on-field DPS, using Skill -> Burst in that order is typically preferable since it allows her to collect the Particles created by her Skill.\n\n\n",
