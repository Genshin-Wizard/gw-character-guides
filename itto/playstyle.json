    "description": "Itto prefers to blend both Normal and Charged strikes. Normal strikes can grant him up to five Superlative Superstrength stacks. He may then employ these stacks to perform a series of Stamina-free Arataki Kesagiri Charged assaults. He performs a single Saichimonji Slash if he lacks Superlative Superstrength.",
