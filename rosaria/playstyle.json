    "description": "Rosaria is a flexible damage-dealing character that may fit into a variety of team configurations. She may be developed as an on-field DPS with her powerful basic strikes or as a support unit that can deal Cryo damage indefinitely while off-field.\n\nWith her Elemental Burst and one of her ascension passives, players with CRIT-reliant teams may utilize Rosaria to enhance the whole party's CRIT Rate. Rosaria also has the greatest normal attack scaling values of any spear user, making her ideal for Superconduct or Chongyun-focused teams.",
