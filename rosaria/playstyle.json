    "description": "Rosaria is a very flexible character that can fit into a wide variety of teams. Her main appeal lies in her burst and the CRIT Rate share she can do with her ascension 4 passive talent after she uses her burst.\n\nBeing as flexible as she is, she mainly fulfills 3 roles which are, an off-field freeze support, melt DPS or just boosting other characters with her CRIT Rate share and raw damage from her skill and burst. \nhow does this look?\n",
