            "value": "Lisa has a very useful defense shred passive when her burst is active from her ascension 4 passive, and being a catalyst user she can hold thrilling tales. However her energy requirements are very high, it is recommended to have around 210-220 er on her and give zhongli the favonius lance\n\nYelan's ascension 4 passive is very useful for Eula, and since Eula has a strong interruption resistance during her burst, she can stay on Bennett's field of effect to maximize her damage.\n\nShenhe's burst reduces opponent's cryo and physical resistance by upto 15%, and her press skill increases burst damage by 15%. While her hold skill increases normal attack damage, it is not recommended that you use the hold skill because of it's cooldown"
