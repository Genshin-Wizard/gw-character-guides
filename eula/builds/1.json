That being said, Wolf's Gravestone's passive and naturally high ATK stat as a 5* weapon makes it comparable to her signature weapon. Luxurious Sealord is also a competitive 4* f2p option thanks to it's passive. Prototype Archaic is a last resort if you have no other weapons.\n__**Other options:**__\n__Serpent Spine__\nA battle pass weapon with a CRIT rate substat and  a powerful passive skill that lets it sometimes rival 5* weapons, however due to it's low base ATK you usually need several ATK buffs\n__Snow-tombed Starsilver__\nA last resort option if you don't have billets/don't want to craft Prototype Archaic, since it is completely free. It's high base ATK + Physical DMG bonus makes it function fairly well, it's passive is especially useful when Rosaria is on the team"
