    "description": "Eula's main source of damage is the Lightfall Sword generated by her burst, the damage dealt by the Lightfall sword is increased by building Lightfall stacks using normal attacks or elemental skills. \nUpon activating her burst, you can build Lightfall stacks for 7 seconds. An easy combo to build 14 stacks is as follows:\n\n**Standard DPS rotation**:\n> Use Eula's Elemental Skill (E)\n> Use Eula's Elemental Burst (Q)\n> N4 Attack\n> Hold Eula's Elemental Skill (Hold E)\n> N4 Attack\n> Detonation\n\nTagging out during her burst allows you to detonate her burst early, this is advised when you are worried that mobs will escape from your attack range, or when you are trying to keep up timed attack buffs such as that from 4x noblesse oblige, 4x tenacity of the millelith and other such buffs.\n\nSince you can reposition Eula during her burst before the Lightfall Sword detonates, it is advised to do so, even if it means building fewer Lightfall Sword stacks, to ensure that you hit the maximum number of mobs.\n\nDo also note that Eula's normal attacks make up a significant portion of her damage, It is recommended to defeat lower hp mobs using her normal attacks.\n\nFore more detailed information, visit the Keqing Mains Guide linked below!",
