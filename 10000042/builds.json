The Black Sword is the go-to in this bracket if you can get it as it has a high CRIT Rate substat and a decent passive. Lion's Roar can be better (and is generally stronger with refines) if you can maintain full uptime on its passive, although it does not fall off too much even without full uptime unless you constantly remove Electro from the enemy."
