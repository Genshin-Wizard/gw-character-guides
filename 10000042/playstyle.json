    "description": "**Physical Keqing**\nWhen using Physical Keqing, instead of touching it again, perform a charged attack after performing her Elemental Skill. This causes a cut near her stilettos and stops her blade from becoming infused with Electro.\n\nThis build has various advantages, including access to a fantastic F2P weapon (Prototype Rancour) and the ability to enhance her damage with the elemental reaction Superconduct (Electro+Cryo). Stamina issues are more prevalent, although they occur in both builds.\n\n**Keqing Electro**\nWhen you utilize Keqing in an Electro fashion, you infuse her blade with Electro by touching her Elemental Skill twice. This teleports her to the stiletto's position.\n\nThis construct is more adaptable and prefers Keqing's constellations if you have them.",
