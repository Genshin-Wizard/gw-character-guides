    "description": "**Support Barbara**\nBarbara's primary role in teams is to operate as a healer, capable of both long-term healing and a massive burst of healing in an emergency. In comparison to her DPS counterpart, this playstyle is quite straightforward to gear.\n\nIt is recommended to swap to barbara to enable her elemental skill, swap to your dps character and repeat. If all your characters are low, you can pop her elemental Burst to heal all party members and continue slaying hilicurls!\n\n**DPS Barbara**\nBarbara has a difficult and specialized position. DPS Barbara is a playstyle with a lot of intricacies and aspects to think about. It capitalizes on Barbara's quick animation cancellations and Vaporize access while also maximizing her field time.",
