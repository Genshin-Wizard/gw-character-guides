    "description": "**Support Barbara**\nBarbara's primary role in teams is to operate as a healer, capable of both long-term healing and a massive burst of healing in an emergency. In comparison to her DPS counterpart, this playstyle is quite straightforward to gear.\n\nIt is recommended to swap to barbara to enable her elemental skill, swap to your dps character and repeat. If all your characters are low, you can pop her elemental Burst to heal all party members and continue slaying hilicurls!\n",
