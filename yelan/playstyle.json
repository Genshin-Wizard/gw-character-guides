    "description": "Yelan may easily be a main DPS or a secondary DPS. The first role implies that she will be active on the field, and you will only switch with other team members to give buffs and supporting damage. Yelan thrives with her elemental burst and elemental talents, whether she's a main DPS or not, but that doesn't mean boosting the damage of her basic attacks is a terrible idea.\n\nBecause her Elemental Skill and Burst deal so much damage, it's easy to overlook Yelan's Charged Shots. However, ignoring these strikes will result in the loss of a convenient and potent source of AoE Hydro DMG.",
