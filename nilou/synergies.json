Ayato, Yelan, Xingqiu, Barbara and Kokomi are recommended, but do note Yelan's Damage increase does **not** apply for Bloom, same with Mona's Omen. \nThe Dendro character has to be Dendro Traveler or Collei, with Dendro Traveler being slightly better in her teams, and both being free. \nA healer is almost always needed due to Bloom damaging the active character.\n"
