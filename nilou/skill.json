This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a watery moon.\n• Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a hurtling Water Wheel that deals AoE Hydro DMG and creates a Tranquility aura that follows your active character around and applies Wet to opponents within its AoE.\n> Nilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer.\nThese effects will be removed once she leaves the field or exits these states.\n**Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring**\n*Elemental Burst*\nBegins the dance of faraway dreams and springs that hear, causing a Lotus of Distant Waters to bloom, dealing AoE Hydro DMG based on Nilou's Max HP and applying the Lingering Aeon effect to all opponents hit.\nAfter an interval, opponents affected by Lingering Aeon will take Hydro DMG.",
