This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a watery moon.\n ·Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a hurtling Water Wheel that deals AoE Hydro DMG and creates a Tranquility aura that follows your active character around and applies Wet to opponents within its AoE.\n> Nilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer.\n These effects will be removed once she leaves the field or exits these states."
