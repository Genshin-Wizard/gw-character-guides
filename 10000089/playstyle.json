    "description": "Furina is a versatile support who provides strong off-field damage and buffs for the team. Majority of her damage comes from her elemental skill, typically used in Ousia before constellation 6. Her burst provide DMG% increase to your team, the caveat being the condition to activate it. As such to activate, Furina typically requires a dedicated teamwide healing such as Jean or Kokomi.",
