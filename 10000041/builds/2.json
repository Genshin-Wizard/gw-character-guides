The Widsith, especially at higher refinements, will have higher general damage than most  5-star catalysts, at the expense of your time. The downtime on this catalyst\u2019s buffs can be ignored in the Elemental Burst focused playstyle. Elemental Mastery sands should only be used when she is able to consistently Vaporize her Elemental Burst or other attacks. \n\n**__Disclaimer__:**\nThis is only useful for getting 1 big damage number, and cannot be used for sustained damage over multiple rotations."
