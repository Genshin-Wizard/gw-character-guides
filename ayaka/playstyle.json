    "description": "In all senses of the term, Ayaka is a burst damage dealer. Her Elemental Burst will propel you to victory in a flash. As a result, her teams' main aim is always the same:\n> Set up as many enemies as possible to be hit by her Burst.\n> Set up as many opponents as possible for her Burst to strike.\n> Buff her up and weaken the foes as much as possible.\n> Unleash her Burst upon the land\n\nMake sure you can repeat the process as many times as necessary.\nLearning how to disperse your energy efficiently among the team is highly encouraged. It's crucial to understand how to keep Ayaka energized and when team talents are off cooldown.\n\nAyaka has a general combination that you should try for every time you prepare for a Burst: [Dash > E > Q]. What occurs next is very ad hoc and reliant on the team. She's one of those unique characters that can serve as both a long-field carry and a quick-switch carry, but the lines blur.\nAyaka frequently swaps out after her Burst to allow the squad to reapply buffs/debuffs before returning to the battle to unleash her Normal/Charged attacks and her Elemental Skill when its cooldown expires.",
