    "description": "Fischl is a formidable character — boasting a high rate of electro application, powerful acension passive in her A4, coupled with high electro-particle generation, strong personal damage in single target, and extremely low maintenance. When consolidating these factors, it can be easily said that Fischl is a poweful yet versatile asset in a multitude of teams.\n\nFischl shines best in teams where she is played alongside other electro characters. Her unparalleled electro particle generation enables electro characters to run significantly lower energy recharge than they otherwise would have as the sole electro.\nEven if there are no other electro characters present in the team, her particle generation is so significant that non-electro characters can have their energy requirements lowered considerably.\n\nHer position as a capable off-field character is further solidified when considering her on-field presence is nearly non-existent — only swapping in to recast her skill/ burst every 12 seconds, providing ample time for the on-field character to capitalize on.\nHaving these low maintenance yet rewarding qualities means that Fischl also functions as a potent flex slot in teams that have a free slot. Not only that, but Fischl is capable of providing a constant stream of non-negligible single-target damage that is well appreciated in many teams.\n\n__Please do not neglect your Fischl__. She is an incredibly capable unit that is worth your time to invest into.",
