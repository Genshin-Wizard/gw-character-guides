    "description": "Aloy's kit—both combat and passive talents—indicates that she is designed to inflict Cryo damage on her foes. She focuses on using her elemental talent to augment her normal attacks as a DPS fighter. You may swap between Aloy and other characters during combat, unlike other DPS characters, without losing the benefits of her talents.\nAloy also plays a part in the Reverse Melt elemental reaction, which is similar to Melt but uses Pyro first before Cryo. Aloy will only be called to the field to unleash her elemental blast for this position.\nThe trickiest element of Aloy's Elemental Skill is convincing opponents to tread on the explosives so she may gain the ATK DMG bonus. If you're up against only one or two foes, for example, you can have problems activating the Chillwater Bomblets, especially if you don't have any Anemo characters to help you dispense with the enemies. Aloy's Elemental Skill is mostly utilized to replenish your team's energy, making her a good Cryo battery backup.\n\nThe optimal rotation for a team containing Aloy typically goes as follows:\n> Use Aloy's Elemental Skill (E).\n> Switch to an Anemo character to group the enemies with the bombs. \n> Switch to Aloy for the Coil Stack bonus and to induce Cryo effects to your opponents.\n> Use Aloy’s Elemental Burst (Q).",
