    "description": "Diluc is a character who can bash and drag around mobs, he has brute strength and can overwhelm virtually any mobs in the game, therefore make sure you continually weave in autos to gain the maximum damage.\n\nAngling your ult is also important since it pushes everyone in that line to the end of where the ult strikes, thus hitting a wall might cause the monsters to receive less damage than you intended.\n\nDiluc should launch a charged strike causing greater and successive Pyro damage to the opponent after utilizing his elemental skill with the Blessing of Phoenix and Relentless. His two passive abilities will be useful in carrying out this attack.",
