    "description": "Bennett is a versatile support that is seen in many team comps. His strength lies in his Elemental Burst, which can buff your DPS's ATK and heals your on-field character. He can also battery your Pyro characters with his Elemental Skill having a short cooldown and generating 2-3 Pyro particles. ",
