If there are, we'll be sure to update them.\nUnfortunately, Dehya's Elemental Burst, despite looking like Normal Attacks do **not** trigger things like Beidou, Yelan or Xingqiu's Elemental Bursts. This is why Nilou and Ayato are listed as the Hydro options. \nHowever, Xingqiu's Rainsword Orbitals (the ones that revolve him) can apply Hydro too.\n\nIf Dehya is not in the first slot, she's the Support of the team."
