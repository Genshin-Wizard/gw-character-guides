There is a limited number of waves that can be triggered in the duration of this skill.\n• Sword, Claymore, and Polearm-wielding character(s) under this effect will obtain a Hydro Infusion.\nThis secret rite has been passed down through Candace's clan from generation to generation. Though the old faiths have become lost over the years, the sands still protect the heirs of the ancient realm."
