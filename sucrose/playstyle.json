    "description": "Sucrose is often used in Reverse Vape teams as an Elemental Mastery buffer and Taser teams as a driver and Viridescent Venerer holder.\n\nBeing a catalyst user, she can use one of the best supporting weapon in the game, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, giving your DPS a massive 48% ATK. Another perk of her being a catalyst user is that her Normal and Charged Attacks can swirl, making certain setups easier with her and dealing extra damage in Taser teams.\n\nHer Elemental Skill pulls enemies in an area around the targeted enemy. It generates 4 Anemo particles when used, making her a good battery for Xiao. When used with Xiangling, it has a unique technique called Guoba Swirl. When you use her Skill right as Guoba is about to fire, it can swirl Pyro off of him, making for some interesting rotations in Xiangling teams.\n\nHer Elemental Burst pulls in enemies and launches them periodically. It can also absorb an element that it touches, dealing additional elemental damage and her C6 would give your team extra Elemental DMG Bonus of the absorbed element. While it can be situationally useful for its crowd control abilities, it is often not used in reaction teams as the absorption is unreliable and it can ruin reactions. ",
