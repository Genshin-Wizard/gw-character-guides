    "description": "Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Skill Attack, and Burst Attack from Sucrose all have their own ICDs. Every pulse/use of Skill and Burst will result in a response. Sucrose players must continually switch up their assault options in order to reliably generate response damage.\n\nThis character's only purpose is to provide assistance; you'll want to swap her in and out of the field so that you can continually CC adversaries and clump them up.\n\nShe is somewhat mobile and has excellent crowd management; her basic skills' power strike pushes foes back, and this, along with her basic skill ability to knock up adversaries, works well to stock up for your ultimate, which bunches together enemies and suspends them in the air.",
