This is in light of the extra pyro application instance messing up the auras on the enemy; resulting in less overloads owned by Yanfei. \n\nShould players have neither of the 4-piece artifact sets that boost her overload damage, running +80 EM 2-piece sets is an option. \nWhen opting for instructors as one of said +80 EM sets, it is recommended to only run the set piece on the flower and feather.
