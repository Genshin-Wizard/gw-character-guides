Spacing out of skill uses when the weapon passive procs is advised in order for electro auras to be maintained.\n\n__Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers__\nProvides a potent buff to a single party member, but mandates a structured rotation in order to properly pass the TTDS buff to the character who benefits most from it.\n** **"

Great multi-buffing qualities coupled with more flexible rotations makes this weapon comparable to the buff of Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers. \n\n** **"

This is in light of the extra pyro application instance messing up the auras on the enemy; resulting in less overloads owned by Yanfei.\n\nShould players have neither of the 4-piece artifact sets that boost her overload damage, running +80 EM 2-piece sets is an option.\nWhen opting for instructors as one of said +80 EM sets, it is recommended to only run the set piece on the flower and feather.
