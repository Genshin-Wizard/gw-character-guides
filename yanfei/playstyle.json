    "description": "**Vaporise Yanfei**\nTo deliver devastating Charged Attacks, Vaporize Yanfei relies on stacking Scarlet Seals and Xingqiu's off-field Hydro application.\n\n**Overload Yanfei**\nOverload Yanfei uses Fischl's A4 Talent to keep an Electro aura on foes, allowing her to repeatedly activate Overload. Yanfei may run as a very inexpensive and comfy driver of the immensely strong Beidou unit with this playstyle.\n\n**Other playstyles**\nOther Yanfei variants include Reverse Melt Yanfei, in which Yanfei provides Pyro application for Rosaria and Kaeya to Melt their Bursts off of, and Mono-Pyro Yanfei, in which Yanfei is on-field while Xiangling and other Pyro, Anemo, and Geo units inflict damage off-field, among others.\n\nTo view a more in-depth guide on this character, check out the KQM guide linked below!",
