    "description": "Razor has a wide variety of playstyles to choose from.\n\n**Physical Carry**\nAs the name suggests, this playstyle focuses more on his Physical DMG portion via Normal Attacks and has Cryo units as a necessity on the team.\n\n**Electro Carry**\nThis playstyle often utilizes Dendro units and reactions and focuses more on his Skill and Burst DMG, there's also a sub-variety of quickswap, which utilizes characters with short Skill and Burst cooldowns allowing for an in-and-out quickswap playstyle.\n\n**Reaction Carry**\nThis playstyle also utilizes Dendro units but for a completely different reason. Razor will be building full Elemental Mastery in these scenarios, focusing more on  Overload, Burgeon, Electro-Charged, and Hyperbloom damage. \n\n**Preferred Normal Attack Sequence**\n\nN4D or 4 Normal Attacks and dash to cancel the animation lag, is preferred on single-target scenarios and Burst-mode. This attack sequence yields higher damage if the necessary conditions are met. \n\nN3D or 3 Normal attacks and dash is for AoE or multi-target scenarios where you don't want lighter enemies getting knocked around. \n\nAnd lastly, always use his Tap Skill version as it yields more damage over time. \n\nFor more detailed information about Razor, check the KQM guide. \n",
