    "description": "Citlali is a shielder and a support, primarly played in in teams triggering melt or freeze. Using skill, CItlali gives your active character a shield that scales with __Elemental mastery__ and enters a nightsoul blessing state. When CItlali's nightsoul points are above 50, she summons Itzpapa, a plushie that does coordinated attacks applying cryo every 2s.\nCitlali starts with 24 nightsoul points after the cast of her skill, another 24 by using her burst, 16 points every 8s a Melt of Freeze reaction is triggered, and 4 points whenever a Nightsoul burst is triggered.\nCitlali's ascension 1 passive also allows her to shred enemies' __pyro__ and __cryo__ resistance whenever Melt or Freeze is triggered, thus making her an amazing support for pyro characters like Mavuika, Yoimiya, Arlecchino or Gaming with Yanfei.",
