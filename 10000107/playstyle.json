    "description": "Citlali is a shielder and a support, primarily played in in teams triggering melt or freeze. Using her Elemental Skill, Citlali provides your active character with a shield that scales with Elemental mastery and enters a Nightsoul blessing state. When Citlali's Nightsoul points are above 50, she summons Itzpapa, a plushie that does coordinated attacks applying Cryo every 2s.\n\nCitlali starts with 24 Nightsoul points after the cast of her skill, another 24 by using her burst, 16 points every 8s a Melt of Freeze reaction is triggered, and 4 points whenever a Nightsoul burst is triggered.\nCitlali's ascension 1 passive also allows her to shred enemies' Pyro and Hydro resistance whenever Melt or Freeze is triggered, thus making her an amazing support for Pyro characters like Mavuika, Hutao, Yoimiya, Arlecchino, Gaming or Yanfei.",
