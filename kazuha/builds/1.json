When using this weapon, crit rate substats are a high priority in order to proc the passive more consistently.\n** **"

However, using the additional skill cast runs into the same issue as his C1; taking more field time that orherwise could have been better utilised by the team\u2019s On-Field DPS units.\nSince Kazuha only deals one elemental skill damage instance, the weapon passive would be very unreliable to proc at lower refinements, with higher refinements aiding but still proc\u2019ing the passive inconsistently.\n** **"
