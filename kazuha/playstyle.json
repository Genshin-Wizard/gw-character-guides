    "description": "Kazuha, like the majority of the other Anemo characters, has powerful crowd control powers incorporated into his arsenal. Chihayaburu, his Elemental Skill, draws in all foes in a large area, and his enhanced Plunge Attack may create a wind vortex that locks adversaries in place. When combined with his Elemental Burst, Kazuha can set up a squad for lightning-fast clear times versus huge groupings of foes.\n\nKazuha is best utilized as an Elemental Mastery DPS character that relies on triggering Swirl with other EM carriers due to the nature of his skills and his attunement to Anemo.\n\nMake a squad that can take use of his Elemental Burst's absorption effect. A frozen field may make triggering Melt and other responses very simple and repeatable.",
