    "description": "Kaedehara Kazuha is one of the best Anemo characters in the game, with powerful crowd control, buffing, and Off-field damage incorporated into his kit. \n\nChihayaburu, his Elemental Skill, launches him into the air and deals an instance of Anemo damage. Performing Chihayaburu allows him to execute a Plunging Attack called Midare Ranzan, converting his Plunging damage into Anemo damage. \n\nKazuha Slash, his Elemental Burst, allows Kazuha to deal both Anemo and damage of an absorbed element in a large AoE. Applying an element apart from Anemo allows Kazuha to both effectively enable other characters and also deal a significant amount of damage while off-field by triggering chain reactions.\n\nKazuha's Ascension Talents are also extremely important. His first Ascension Talent allows him to absorb an element on his Elemental Skill, which both allows him to swirl more times on his Elemental Skill and deal more damage, but also allows him to perform Double VV setups with his Elemental Skill alone (where Kazuha swirls multiple elements, shredding enemies' resistance to multiple elements). Kazuha's Ascension Four talent allows him to provide his teammates with an Elemental DMG% buff, which synergizes well with the Viridescent Venerer set and allows Kazuha to be an even more effective support/Off-field DPS.\n\nKazuha functions well in nearly every team, including Freeze, Tazer, and Reverse Vape. The only teams in which he doesn't function as well are Anemo/Geo teams where he doesn't have an element to swirl.",
