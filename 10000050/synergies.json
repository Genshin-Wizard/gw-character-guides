As a way to prevent Thoma from interrupting Hu Tao’s Vaporizes, it is recommended to opt for N1C(one Normal Attack followed by a Charged Attack) combos. Xingqiu's C6, Yelan's C2 and/or a Hydro absorbed Elemental Burst from Sucrose or Kazuha can help alleviate this issue.\n\nYoimiya appreciates ATK% buffs so consider bringing Heizou or Sucrose equipped with Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers over Kazuha.\n"
