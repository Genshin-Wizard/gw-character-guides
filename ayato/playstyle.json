    "description": "Ayato is a rather straightforward character to use, relying on his Elemental Skill to consistently attack when on cooldown, and then buffing himself or his teammates' Normal Strikes for even more frequent attacks when his Burst is available.\nAn on-field DPS Ayato, as the name says, spends a long time on the field and uses two skills every burst. Ayato's Shunsuiken strikes are the major source of damage in this playstyle (the converted Normal Attacks in his Takimeguri Kanka state after casting his Skill).\nAs a Burst DPS, Ayato foregoes one Skill every Burst in order to save field time, opting instead to use his Burst's AoE off-field Hydro application.",
