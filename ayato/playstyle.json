    "description": "Ayato is a strong yet versatile unit who can be played as both a burst DPS, and an on-field damage dealer.\n\nAyato is best played as an on-field DPS, utilizing his kit to the fullest extent via capitalizing on his Elemental Skill, using 2 Skills per Burst. In this manner, Ayato spends an extend period of time on-field split into 2 separate windows, lowering his ER requirements.\n\nWhile not his best option, Ayato can be used as a Burst DPS, forgoing one skill use per burst to enable his teammates with off-field AoE Hydro application from his burst while taking less field time from them. When opting for this play style, Ayato requires much more ER to compensate the loss of a Skill use per Burst.",
