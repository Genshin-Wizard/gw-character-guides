However in freeze comps, when opting to run 4 Blizzard, Ayato will very easily overcap on crit rate. In such a situation, it would be better to run an alternative weapon instead.\n\n__Favonius Sword__\nOwing to Ayato\u2019s extraordinarily high ER requirments in this playstyle, Favonius sword is a strong weapon to manage his ER requirements, as well as the added utility of Favonius triggers lowering team ER requirements.\n\n__Mistsplitter\u2019s Reforged__\nAnother personal damage focused weapon that does not run into issues in freeze team comps.\n\n__Skyward Blade__\nA more offense-oriented weapon compared to Favonius Sword with a large ER stat that is very appreciated in this playstyle to keep his ER requirements in-check.\n\n__The Black Sword__\nGeneral weapon option that still persists even in this playstyle. However, it runs into the same issue as Primordial Jade Cutter in overcapping crit rate when running 4 Blizzard.\n** **"

However, should players not have enough blizzard pieces, priority of who gets the Blizzard pieces goes to the Cryo DPS while Ayato opts to run 4 Emblem of Severed Fate instead.\nIn teams where there are no 4 Noblesse Oblige holders, Ayato can sacrifice some of his personal damage to hold the 4 set and buff his teammates instead.\n"
