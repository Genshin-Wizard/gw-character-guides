Its Elemental Mastery and ATK% buffs are very helpful. The ER stat is great for her, as running ER sands may no longer be necessary in some teams. On others, it can be a loss for her personal DPS but is usually made up for by the gain in team DPS.\n\n__Favonius Warbow__\nConditionally very good; as Ganyu gets CRIT Rate from many sources, getting its passive off can be consistent depending on the team composition, decreasing ER requirements and thus increasing potential team DPS.
