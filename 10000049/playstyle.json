    "description": "Yoimiya is a very simple unit whose kit is based around her Normal Attacks. Her elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, infuses her Normal Attacks with Pyro and increases her Normal Attack damage for ten seconds. Players should aim to maximize the damage dealt by her normal attacks, meaning that they should stack buffs on her normal attacks.\n\nHowever, Yoimiya's Elemental Burst is relatively unimportant to her kit. While it does offer a small amount of damage and a team buff, players should only cast it every other rotation and shouldn't try to actively battery Yoimiya to cast her burst every rotation.\n\nYoimiya's Elemental Burst being a less important part of her kit doesn't mean that players shouldn't care about it; it still deals a small bit of damage and buffs Yoimiya's teammates. Yoimiya's Elemental Burst should be cast before her teammates cast their abilities. This is because its buff will trigger on cast, so if Yoimiya's teammates want to be buffed by its buff, it needs to be cast first. This is especially important if Yoimiya is being used with ATK-scaling off-field DPS units such as Beidou, Xingqiu, and Fischl.\n\nAnother important thing to note about Yoimiya is that her most damaging hit is her N5, which is at the *end* of her Normal Attack string. In order to maximize Yoimiya's damage, she needs to be able to perform her entire Normal Attack string uninterrupted, meaning that she nearly requires a shielder in many of her teams.\n\nFor more information on Yoimiya, check out the KQM guide linked below!",
