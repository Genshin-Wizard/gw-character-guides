    "description": "Jean is one of the simpler characters to play among the numerous available in Genshin Impact. She excels at inflicting massive amounts of damage all at once. Add to that the fact that she can heal members of the party at the same time.\n\nA character that can kill and heal at the same time is lethal, and she may be used in a variety of scenarios. An article compared her to a shotgun, capable of rapidly eliminating an enemy. This is an accurate description, however this shotgun also heals allies.\n\nYou could point Jean in the direction of any adversary and start firing, much like a shotgun. You'll be shocked by what she's capable of.\n\nYou may use Gale Blade to drive adversaries away to get some space, or to gather them and wipe them out.\n\nFinally, Jean's playstyle might be defined as point and shoot; it is particularly successful at removing threats from Teyvat's face.",
