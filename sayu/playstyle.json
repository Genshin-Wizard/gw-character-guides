    "description": "While Sayu is a little ninja, her preferred weapon is the Claymore. She's also a very entertaining Support character, relying on her Elemental Burst to heal and do AoE damage.\n\nShe'll be on your squad mostly as a Support and Healer, so organize your team properly. To take use of Swirl elemental responses from her Burst, I'd recommend matching her with a character that has an AoE Elemental Burst or Skill.",
