    "description": "Palm Vortex, an Anemo Traveler's Elemental Skill, may be utilized to not only draw enemies in, but also to disseminate elemental auras or applications to nearby enemies. This is excellent for constructing big Swirl and other Elemental Reaction chains. Because they don't spend much time on-field, Anemo Traveler is classified as a 'Sub DPS,' and there isn't truly a 'Support' build because the only benefit they give to the team is a predetermined amount of Elemental RES Shred, independent of their stats. This implies they're best used as a Quickswap unit with invested teammates and a strong team damage output.\nBecause the support bonuses provided by Anemo Travelers are not dependent on weapons or artifacts, the purpose when creating them is to maximize their personal damage. Because it is not encouraged to develop Physical DMG with Normal or Charged Attacks, they are frequently employed to activate weapon effects.",
