    "description": "Jean is an Anemo healer. As a lot of teams want a healer and an Anemo character to use the 4pc Viridescent Venerer set, Jean is an excellent choice in those teams as a 2 in 1 unit.\n\nJean is not just usable in the previously described teams however. Her Anemo energy generation and overall utility makes her a useful unit in a magnitude of teams.",
