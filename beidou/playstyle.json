    "description": "It's quite simple to play Beidou as your On-Field Main Carry. Because Beidou collects on field particles, it has lower ER needs. In terms of damage, she is mostly supported by her talents, as her normals are woefully inadequate. While it may be tempting to invest in her normals in order to boost their damage, the gain is insignificant.\nOnly if Beidou had the majority of your money would Field Carry be really 'ideal.' In these situations, treating Beidou as a Hypercarry and equipping her with a battery and buffers is an excellent method to take use of her huge multipliers; think of her as Electro Xiao",
