The 51.8% of Energy Recharge Sands is unnecessary when running a battery. Due to the Electro Resonance, it places her energy requirements between 120% to 140%, and if running the Emblem of Severed Fate set, the amount needed from substats is 0% to 20%.\nThe Electro Traveler lowers her energy requirements to 100%, and as her Energy Recharge transfer does not work with the Emblem of Severed Fate set, it is not recommended to run this set. The 2-piece Thundering Fury, 2-piece Noblesse Oblige or 2-piece Attack set will be better. "
