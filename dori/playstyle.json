    "description": "**Support**\nUse her Elemental Skill or another character\u2019s Elemental Skill to battery her. Then place down her burst, using the connection between character and the lamp to damage enemies and heal the active character. Dori\u2019s Elemental Burst applies Electro to the active character, so if running or fighting Pyro enemies, it is recommended to bring a shield if you cannot dodge, as she will trigger self-Overloads. \nThis infusion can be used to Swirl Electro with an Anemo support to set up for your main DPS or form crystalized shields in Geo teams. The self-Swirl mechanic is well paired with Jean, who swirls the active character, and paired with Bennett and high Elemental Mastery Jean, Dori is able to work in a self-Swirl Overload teams. \nOverall, Dori\u2019s playstyle is relatively simple, involving batterying her then using your on-field character within the radius of the lamp. Dori\u2019s healing is relatively average, meaning ok, but not enough to merit running her over another healing unit that may provide other utilities. \nHer burst does have a refund but scams you and doesn\u2019t give back that much, meaning you should not trust the passive for getting your burst off cooldown.\n*Just in case you wanted another battery who needs a battery to battery~*",
