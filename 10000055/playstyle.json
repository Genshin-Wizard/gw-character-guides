    "description": "Gorou is mostly used in Noelle and Itto teams, as he buffs their DEF and Geo DMG Bonus. He can also battery them by generating 2 Geo Particles on his Elemental Skill.\nHis Playstyle is very simple, just use his Elemental Skill, Burst, then swap out. Though it should be noted that you can't alt-swap to Itto, as he won't receive Gorou's DEF buffs.",
