    "description": "Childe is a Main DPS as well as a Burst DPS. Childe has an excellent Enabling Main DPS window and an excellent Elemental Burst. The major role of your Childe is determined by his strength. In general, utilize your Bursts near the beginning of the Abyss floor (because your skills start off full). This implies that your first damage will be burst DPS, followed by sustain DPS. Childe is a Burst DPS if his burst damage eliminates the majority of his adversaries' HP. If it doesn't, Childe will switch to melee and team rotation as an Enabling Main DPS.\n\nThis means that the more involved and prepared your Childe is, the more drawn he will be to the Burst DPS job. However, once you've achieved his damage cap, you may still use him as your primary DPS. It simply implies that at his damage ceiling, he will be more effective as a Burst DPS rather than a Main DPS. Childe as a Burst DPS requires a different mix of weapons and artifacts than Childe as a Main DPS, which may not be appealing to everyone.",
