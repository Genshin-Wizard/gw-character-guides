    "description": "Childe is an on-field enabling DPS, with a powerful nuke burst. Childe teams generally succeed when Childe is on-field, strengthening the damage of off-field DPS units, before a battery period during Childe\u2019s cooldown. The key to Childe is managing your rotation and team around the cooldown generated by Childe\u2019s fieldtime.\n\nChilde\u2019s Burst contributes significant damage for the team, so it is recommended to vaporize it and buff it where possible. A team can be played around Childe\u2019s Burst, however it often requires specific high investment that can differentiate from the traditional on-field enabling damage build.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to stay in (C0) Childe Melee for 7-9 seconds, before switching to batterying. This doesn\u2019t usually utilize the full duration of the off-field unit/s\u2019 abilities, however Childe\u2019s personal damage and significant AoE overcome this. A Childe team maximizes team output, instead of focusing on one unit above the other. Due to the flexibility of Childe\u2019s Melee uptime and cooldown, adjusting the time spent in melee to be longer can be very helpful for finishing off the last few enemies, or shortened to enable a quicker rotation if needed.\n\nIn multi-target Childe has quadratic scaling on his Riptide Slash (triggered by melee hit on a target with Riptide Mark). This means that Childe\u2019s damage scales higher and higher with more enemies, and he is a strong pick for multi-target situations, especially when paired with an off-field DPS who can hit multiple enemies.\n\nFor more information, check out the Childe Guide linked below, and its authors Childe Mains at discord.gg /Childe",
