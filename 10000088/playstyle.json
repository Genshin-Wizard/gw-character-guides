    "description": "Charlotte is a 4 star Cryo Catalyst character whose main role is to provide teamwide healing through her Elemental Burst. She can also apply Cryo off-field, making her a great user of supportive artifact sets like Noblesse Oblige or Tenacity of the Millelith, respectively.\n\nAs a teamwide healer, Charlotte has strong synergy with Furina, and is often paired with her to enable faster Fanfare stacking.",
