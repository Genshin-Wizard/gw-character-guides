    "description": "Albedo functions mostly as a Geo Turret by placing his Elemental Skill Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma down. It provides consistent Geo damage output and eventual Crystallize Shields. Being a rather fragile Geo Construct means you\u2019ll have a hard time against bosses that are able to destroy it. \n\nExtended field time requirement and split-scaling on his Elemental Burst up until C2 discourages its usage in most teams. However, the 125EM it provides on cast is very much appreciated by Vaporize teams. ",
