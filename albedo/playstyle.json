    "description": "Albedo shines the most as a utility and sub-DPS, leveraging his burst and geo ability to shield and keep people safe, as well as employing the flower for other characters to keep them safe while allowing them to freely deal massive damage.\n\nBennett or Mona, fantastic support characters that augment damage, Fischl or Ganyu, who can use his lotus to stay out of harm's path, and Childe, who can use the range but also take use of the shield and going up close, are all characters who would work well with Albedo.",
