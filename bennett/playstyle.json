    "description": "Bennett can be seen at the start of every battle or in all those fancy oneshot clips you may come across; you watch him ult as soon as the fight starts. That's because the ult may heal individuals, apply a pyro dot on foes standing in it, and boost the amount of damage taken by creatures in it.\n\nKeeping your ult up is critical while playing Bennett, therefore weaving him in and out for long drawn out bouts may charge his ult and drastically shorten the fight length.\n\nSimilar to support, you should always fight around Bennett's ult because it improves his damage. So, when slashing with your sword, take use of the fact that you do extra damage due to your ability.",
