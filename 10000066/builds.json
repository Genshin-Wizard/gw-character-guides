Thus, it is not recommended to pull for Haran should player’s have the Primordial Jade Cutter and likewise.\n\n__The Black Sword__\n4 star Best-in-Slot weapon with its stat spread and passive being largely beneficial to Ayato’s kit. However, it should be noted that the weapon does not scale all that well with refines, thus purchasing multiple battlepasses to refine the weapon is not advisable.\n\n__Lions Roar__\nObtainable via gacha, Lions Roar is a strong weapon as Ayato’s predominant teams are electrocharge and soup; both of which can keep consistently high uptime on the passive of Lions Roar.\n** **"

Although perfectly usable, it is much preferred to use the weapon on other characters who would gain more benefit using the weapon than Ayato would.\n\n__Light of Foliar Incision__\nHis fast attacks are not Normal Attack, but the CRIT stats are helpful.\n\n__Cursed Blade__\nA F2P friendly and decent weapon option should players not have any of the weapons mentioned above.\n\n__Amenoma Kageuchi__\nAyato usually casts his burst at the start of the rotation, rendering the energy gained from the weapon passive near-useless. Thus, players will still need to build the same amount of ER as they did with any other weapon to be able to burst on the subsequent rotations."
