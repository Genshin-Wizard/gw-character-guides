Thus, it is not recommended to pull for Haran should player\u2019s have the Primordial Jade Cutter and likewise.\n\n__The Black Sword__\n4 star Best-in-Slot weapon with its stat spread and passive being largely beneficial to Ayato\u2019s kit. However, it should be noted that the weapon does not scale all that well with refines, thus purchasing multiple battlepasses to refine the weapon is not advisable.\n\n__Lions Roar__\nObtainable via gacha, Lions Roar is a strong weapon as Ayato\u2019s predominant teams are electrocharge and soup; both of which can keep consistently high uptime on the passive of Lions Roar.\n** **"

Although perfectly usable, it is much preferred to use the weapon on other characters who would gain more benefit using the weapon than Ayato would.\n\n__Cursed Blade__\nA F2P friendly and decent weapon option should players not have any of the weapons mentioned above.\n\n__Amenoma Kageuchi__\nAyato usually casts his burst at the start of the rotation, rendering the energy gained from the weapon passive near-useless. Thus, players will still need to build the same amount of ER as they did with any other weapon to be able to burst on the subsequent rotations.\n** **"

Otherwise, it is better to farm for 4 Heart of Depth as the artifact passive is essentially unconditional while simultaneously being able to farm for Blizzard Strayer pieces \u2014 another common artifact set utilized by many cryo characters."
