    "description": "Ayato is a strong yet versatile unit who can be played as both On-Field DPS, as well as an Off-field Hydro Applicator/ Burst DPS.\n\nAyato is best played as an On-Field DPS, utilizing his kit to the fullest extent by capitalizing on his Elemental Skill, using 2 Skills per rotation separated into different damage-windows; dropping his ER requirements to become manageable in the process. When utilising this playstyle, it is advisable to run Ayato in teams with characters that have split damage-windows. Namely, Fischl and anemo VV holders like Kazuha and Jean are some of such teammates that synergies well together with Ayato.\n\nAlthough not his best playstyle, Ayato can be used as a Burst DPS/ Off-Field Hydro Applicator \u2014 forgoing one skill use per burst to enable his teammates while taking less field time from them. When opting to run Ayato in this playstyle, the scope of his build changes owing to the different Skill : Burst damage ratio in addition to his much higher ER requirements. ",
