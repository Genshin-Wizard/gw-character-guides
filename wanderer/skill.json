Charged Attacks no longer consume Stamina. While this state is active, The Wanderer's movements gain the following properties: \n>·Persistently consumes Sky-Dweller Points to maintain this hovering state. \n>·When sprinting, additional Sky-Dweller Points will be consumed for The Wanderer to sprint mid-air. Holding sprint will cause persistent Sky-Dweller Point consumption to maintain speed.\n>·Jumping expends extra Sky-Dweller Points to increase hovering height. Holding jump will cause persistent Sky-Dweller Point consumption to keep increasing hovering height. \nRunning out of Sky-Dweller Points will end the Windfavored state. \nA second cast during the duration of Windfavored will also end it."
