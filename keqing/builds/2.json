Mistsplitter Reforged is the worst of the three because this build does not take advantage of its Elemental DMG bonuses; Summit Shaper without a shield is also slightly worse than Haran Geppaku Futsu.\n\n__The Black Sword, Prototype Rancour__\nThe Black Sword is generally better if you can afford it. Prototype Rancour, the free option, is not too far behind and can improve very slightly with refinements, but it is not recommended to use your billets in that manner."
