When Eula's own Normal Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst deal DMG to opponents, they will charge the Lightfall Sword, which can gain an energy stack once every 0.1s.\nOnce its duration ends, the Lightfall Sword will descend and explode violently, dealing Physical DMG to nearby opponents.\nThis DMG scales on the number of energy stacks the Lightfall Sword has accumulated.\nIf Eula leaves the field, the Lightfall Sword will immediately explode."
