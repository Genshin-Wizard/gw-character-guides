Wolf's Gravestone's passive and naturally high ATK stat as a 5* weapon makes it comparable to her signature weapon. This is similar for Beacon of the Reed Sea, which gives CRIT Rate and ATK%. Luxurious Sealord and Akuaoumaru are a great options, boosting her Elemental Burst damage alongside their ATK% substat. \n__**Other options:**__\n__Serpent Spine__\nA battle pass weapon with a CRIT rate substat and  a powerful passive skill that lets it sometimes rival 5* weapons, due to it's low base ATK, ATK% buffs scale very well.\n__Snow-tombed Starsilver__\nAn alternative option if you don't have billets or don't want to craft Prototype Archaic, since it is completely free. It has a high base ATK stat + Physical DMG bonus, and it's passive is especially useful when Rosaria is on the team"
