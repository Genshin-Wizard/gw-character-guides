The passive can not be activated on the first rotation but it's long duration means it can be procced in subsequent ones which would boost the teams EM greatly. Much more reliable with C4"

The passive is not reliable with teams that have Nahida in them because of her high Dendro Application.\n\n__ Festering Desire__ ER substat helps alleviate ER reqs and also boosts Skill DMG% with its passive.\n\n__ Iron Sting__ Craftable sword with EM substat and DMG% passive make it a good option for Kuki.\n\nOther Weapons: Mistsplitter Reforged, Light of Foliar Incision, Haran Geppaku Futsu, Freedom Sworn, Toukabou Shigure, Dark Iron Sword\n\n"
