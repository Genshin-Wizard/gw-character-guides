The passive helps boost her teams total damage.\n\n__Key of Khaj-Nsut__ HP% Passive increases Kuki\u2019s healing. 3 stacks are easily obtained at C4 due to it granting her an extra Skill proc. It is not recommended to prolong rotations to gain extra stacks at lower Constellations.\n\n__Xiphos' Moonlight__ EM substat which strengthens her Hyperbloom damage along with ER share to the whole team."

Gives lower EM than other weapons."
