    "description": "The Geo Traveler is most commonly used as a Quickswap DPS, where they are switched in to utilize their Elemental Skill and Burst as often as possible, because they have strong multipliers, low cooldowns, and need very little field time.\n\nWhen constructed appropriately, they may enhance the squad with CRIT Rate and resilience to interruption while also doing significant damage to themselves. Not to note that Geo Traveler only need 130 percent ER to utilize Elemental Burst off CD due to C4, which is attainable with artifact substats.\n\nNormal Attacks are only utilized on rare occasions to trigger things like Xingqiu or Beidou's Elemental Burst, because the damage from them is insignificant and spending the time to perform them lessens the total team damage.",
