But in some scenarios/teams weapons like Xiphos' and Favonius can be better. Still, even for supporting capabilities, its a really good choice.\n\n__Xiphos' Moonlight__\nKazuha's best 4 star weapon option when refinements are equal with Favonius Sword (keep in mind that its far more easy to get refinements on favonius sword). Gives significant amounts of ER through his EM to self and his team. It can even be better than Freedom Sworn in teams that dont benefit from the 16% Normal, Charged, and Plunge DMG bonus% Freedom Sworn gives.\n\n__Favonius Sword__\nProvides extreme comfort with an ER mainstat, as well as a passive that aids in further reducing his ER requirements, alongside his team’s. When using this weapon, crit rate substats are a high priority in order to proc the passive more consistently."

                "value": "__Iron Sting__\nConsiderable 4 star option because of its EM mainstat. Tho its passive is useless with full EM build, its still one of his top choices if players cant obtain the Freedom Sworn, Xiphos' Moonlight or a high refinement Favonius Sword.\n\n__Dark Iron Sword__\nProvides slightly less EM than Iron Sting but is still a very competitive option — especially for players who do not have the billets or want to save the billets to craft a different weapon, namely Amenoma Kageuchi, instead.\n\n__Sacrificial Sword__\nAn ER stat stick which allows for chaining multiple skill uses in one window. However, using the additional skill cast runs into the same issue as his C1; taking more field time that otherwise could have been better utilised by the team’s On-Field DPS units.\nSince Kazuha only deals one elemental skill damage instance, the weapon passive would be very unreliable to proc at lower refinements, with higher refinements aiding but still proc’ing the passive inconsistently."
