Additionally it's HP% substat allows her to still deal competent damage if the team requires it"

Additionally its passive buffs multiple teammates at once, making it an especially powerful option for taser teams.\n__Prototype Amber, Everlasting Moonglow:__\nShould you find yourself playing a team that requires Kokomi to contribute significantly to team damage then these weapons may be useful. Everlasting Moonglow being her signature weapon has a HP% substat, as well as a passive that helps with her on field damage and energy needs. Prototype Amber does the same but to a much smaller extent due to it's lower stats as a 4* weapon"
