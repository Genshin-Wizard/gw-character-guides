    "description": "Elemental Burst increases the effectiveness of her Normal and Charged Attacks. It also boosts her Bake-Kurage, the harm of the jellyfish, and its duration on the field. Furthermore, all of Kokomi's attacks restore HP to all adjacent party members. Oh, we almost forgot about the finest part. After triggering her Elemental Burst, Kokomi may walk on water.\n\nOne of the reasons many players choose to ignore Kokomi's flag is her passive talent, Flawless Strategy. This skill grants her a 100% reduction in CRIT Rate.\n\nAn optimal rotation for a Kokomi team composition typically:\n> Use Kokomi's Elemental Skill (E)\n> Swap and and recharge Kokomi's burst\n> Swap in and pop Kokomi's Elemental Burst (Q) to attack and heal your team again.",
