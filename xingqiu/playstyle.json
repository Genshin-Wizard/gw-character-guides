    "description": "Xingqiu is an off-field DPS character. His main strength lies in his Elemental Burst Guhua Sword: Raincutter which does Hydro damage whenever the on-field character does a normal attack. This is helpful for setting up reactions like Vaporize, Electrocharged and Freeze.\n\nIn addition to his Elemental Burst doing Hydro damage it also creates a pseudo-shield in the form of Rain Swords that orbits around the character. These Rain Swords can be created by his Elemental Skill as well. They provide additional Hydro application in close contact, some Resistance to Interruption, Damage Reduction and a micro-heal if shattered by an attack or whenever its duration expires. Rain Swords created by Guhua Sword: Raincutter cannot be shattered throughout its duration. \n",
