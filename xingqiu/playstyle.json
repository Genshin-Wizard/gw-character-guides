    "description": "**DPS Character**\nMost people utilize Xingqiu as damage support since his elemental skill and elemental burst stay even when switching characters. But he may also serve as your primary DPS.\n\nBecause of the way Xingqiu's elemental burst works, he should be paired with characters whose offensive playstyles center on regular attacks.\n\n**Healer**\nXingqiu's kit additionally makes advantage of his Max HP because one of his passive skills regenerates the active character's HP when one of the Rain Swords is broken or when its time expires. It heals Xingqiu for 6% of his maximum health.",
