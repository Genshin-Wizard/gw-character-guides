She can utilize 2 out of 3 buffs, though the ATK buff is completely useless for her. \n__Ring of Yaxche__\nCraftable catalyst that is similar to The Widsith, giving HP% and Normal Attack buff.\n__A thousand floating dreams__\nA solid stat stick that boosts Mualani's Elemental Mastery, enhancing her Vaporize damage.\n__Tome of the Eternal Flow__\nProvides CRIT DMG and HP%, both of which are valuable stats for Mualani."
