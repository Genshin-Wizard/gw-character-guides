    "description": "Xiangling works best as a support character to help your team's stars. Switch to Xiangling, use her Elemental Skill to summon Guoba and, if available, her Elemental Burst, then switch to another character. Both will be in effect after you switch.\n\nThis combination allows you to unleash brief bursts of Pyro damage in addition to the damage output of your primary DPS character. The finest Xiangling builds frequently focus around increasing her Pyro damage and the strength of her support nature for your squad.",
