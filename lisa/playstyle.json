    "description": "When utilizing Lisa, the playstyle is to constantly launch assaults at opponents by repeating ordinary and charged strikes as well as her elemental talent. Her elemental talent has a one-second cooldown when used, making it exceedingly simple to spam. This talent may also be charged to deliver more damage by holding the skill button or symbol for many seconds.\n\n**Important Note:** Lisa will remain motionless in place when using Violet Arc's Conductive Hold attack, putting her vulnerable to opposing strikes. This is why having a shielder on Lisa's squad is advised.",
