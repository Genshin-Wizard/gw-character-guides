    "description": "A simple to play and execute character, Yoimiya.\n\nWhen Yoimiya's Elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, is used, her Normal Attacks get enhanced damage and Pyro-infusion for ten seconds. This ability is the foundation of Yoimiya's gameplay, as it is where she gets practically all of her damage. You should use it every time you swap in Yoimiya to do damage.\n\nAlthough many players think Yoimiya's Elemental Burst is weak, it really accounts for up to 20% of her overall damage and should not be overlooked. Yoimiya can actually use her Burst at the start of her rotation, utilize the entire length of her Skill, and then use her Burst again before switching out if she has enough Energy Recharge.\n\nUnless you want to whack enemies with Yoimiya's bow, you should keep as much distance from opponents as possible. Unfortunately, Hilichurls are incredibly fast, and you may soon find yourself encircled despite your best efforts to avoid them.\n\nThis is why you should equip Yoimiya with a shield, as she benefits from one more than any other character in Genshin Impact. Yoimiya has low base HP and DEF, rendering her vulnerable to enemy assaults. She must also use her whole Normal Attack string to optimize her damage—if Yoimiya is staggered while attacking or if you must dodge repeatedly, her DPS will suffer.\n\nFor more information on Yoimiya, and I mean an insanely detailed guide, it is recommended to go ahead and check the KQM guide linked below!",
