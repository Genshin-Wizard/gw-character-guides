The passive takes a few plunges to stack up.\n\n__Staff of Homa__\nBest in slot if you can keep him under 50% HP. That can be a big ask though, as he will need a good Shielder, and you may need to intentionally get hit once or twice to activate it initially. But even at 100% HP, Homa is just so good that it is about on par with other 5*s.\n\n__Blackcliff Pole/Deathmatch__\nAbout even, which one is better will depend on your CRIT Ratio.\n\n__Lithic Spear__\nUnless you're running Double Hydro Xiao, he will not be paired with many Liyue characters other than Zhongli. However, even with just 2 Liyue characters, the spear is about even with Blackcliff Pole/Deathmatch. An R3-5 4Liyue Lithic Spear is significantly better than PJWS and Staff of Homa. Practically it will not be that good, due to teamcomp restrictions.\n"

Unshielded it is a bit worse than Calamity Queller. Falls off a bit if you use both Bennett and TTDS.\n\n__Favonius Lance__\nNot as good as other 4*s for Xiao's personal damage, but can help smooth out energy requirements for him and his team. "
