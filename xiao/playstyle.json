    "description": "With his plunge strikes, Xiao's playstyle relies on dealing AoE damage. Lemniscatic Wind Cycling, his Elemental Skill, has two charges. Xiao dashes ahead and deals Anemo DMG to foes in his path once pressed. This skill is used to perform a plunge attack.\n\nIn most cases, the best rotation for a Xiao squad is as follows:\n> To obtain Energy, activate Xiao's Elemental Skill. Make use of both charges.\n> Shield, buff, or heal Xiao by switching to your allies.\n> Return to Xiao and activate his Elemental Burst.\n> As if there's no tomorrow, spammers are launching all-out assaults.\n\nXiao's style of play isn't for everyone, especially if you get dizzy often when playing. If you're not used to it, the constant up and down action can be irritating to watch.",
