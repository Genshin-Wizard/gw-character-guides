    "description": "Xiao's playstyle relies on dealing AoE Anemo DMG through his plunge attacks. His Elemental Skill, Lemniscatic Wind Cycling, comes with two charges and allows Xiao to dash ahead while dealing Anemo DMG to foes in his path. Note that his Skill does not generate particles during his Burst.\n\nIn most cases the best rotations for a Xiao team is as follows:\n> Activate Skills and Bursts for Supports and Sub-DPSes.\n> Pre-funnel your Anemo battery's Elemental Skill (if applicable) and two of Xiao's Elemental Skills into activating his Elemental Burst.\n> Spam as many plunges as possible.\n\nXiao's style of play isn't for everyone, especially if you get dizzy often when playing. If you're not used to it, the constant up and down action can be irritating to watch.",
