If there are no Mirrors at this time, he will generate 1 additional Mirror. Chisel-Light Mirrors will have the following properties:\n<:blurplejoinarrow:932413900073369621> When he possesses Chisel-Light Mirrors, Alhaitham's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to Dendro DMG. This cannot be overridden.\n<:blurplejoinarrow:932413900073369621> When attacks of the aforementioned kind hit opponents, the Chisel-Light Mirrors will unleash a Projection Attack that deals AoE Dendro DMG based on the number of Mirrors on the field.\n<:blurplejoinarrow:932413900073369621> A total of 3 Chisel-Light Mirrors can exist at once.\n<:blurplejoinarrow:932413900073369621> The Chisel-Light Mirrors will disappear one after the other over time, and will all disappear when Alhaitham leaves the field.\n\n\"Truth inherently exists amidst uncertainty. Even the greatest of scholars are not immune to error.\"\n**Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena**\n*Elemental Burst*\nCreates a Particular Binding Field and deals multiple instances of AoE Dendro DMG.\nIf Chisel-Light Mirrors exist when this ability is unleashed, all such Mirrors will be consumed and increase the number of DMG instances dealt.\n2s after this ability is unleashed, if 0/1/2/3 Mirrors were consumed, Alhaitham will generate 3/2/1/0 new Mirrors in turn.\n\n\"If a researcher makes wisdom their goal, then they should be prepared to make an enemy of every word they read. Only then can they avoid bias.\"\n",
