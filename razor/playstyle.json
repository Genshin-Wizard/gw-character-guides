    "description": "When battling Razor, begin each attack with the press version of Claw and Thunder. Switch to Razor's standard attack combination after landing a hit, but sprint right before the last strike. The last hit of the four strikes combo is sluggish and causes little damage; dash to interrupt the animation and continue the usual attack combo. After two cycles of conventional attacks, you should be able to attack with Claw and Thunder.\n\nLightning Fang accelerates each strike and adds an extra hit of Electro damage with each hit. You may take advantage of the increased attack speed by landing the whole standard attack combination, since the last hit will not take nearly as long to land. Equip Razor with the Wolf's Gravestone to deliver the most damage. If you don't already have this five-star weapon, you can construct the four-star Prototype Archaic.\n\nThough Razor does deliver Electro damage, the majority of his strikes are conventional assaults. Concentrate on Genshin Impact artifacts that increase Flat Attack, Physical Damage, and Crit Rate. The four-piece Pale Flame set is the greatest four-star choice for Razor, as it increases physical damage by 25%. He also gains a 9% attack bonus for seven seconds anytime he uses his elemental talent on an enemy. You can stack this effect twice, increasing the 25 percent physical damage bonus to 100 percent.",
