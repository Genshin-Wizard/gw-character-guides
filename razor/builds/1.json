            "value": "__Song of Broken Pines__\nA very consistent and strong weapon on physical Razor. The ATK Speed buff does not affect HitLag, which can be a considerable chunk of Razor's rotations as a Claymore character. This means it doesn't buff his damage as much as one would think, but is still appreciated.\n\n__Wolf's Gravestone__\nProvides damage similar to SoBP, but isn't as consistent due to the difficulty in getting its passive up against tanky enemies such as bosses.\n\nRedhorn Stonethresher and Shielded Unforged are just slightly weaker than these two options. "

            "value": "__Serpent Spine__\nA great weapon. Its passive is more consistent than one would imagine, and generally will only be drained by a large number of consecutive hits (quite rare). Its R5 is equivalent to the 5* weapons, but it is not recommended to pay for the battle pass just for it (don't spend money on png like me). An ATK% goblet is generally better with SS, depending on substats.\n\n__Prototype Archaic__\nDespite Snow-Tombed Starsilver's physical damage substat, the more general Prototype Archaic is the objectively better F2P option. Refinements can add to DPS, but not a very significant amount.\n\nSkyward Pride is about even with the R1 Serpent Spine, and gets better in AOE scenarios. "
