    "description": "Using the Electro Traveler as an electro battery is what his whole kit is based off of and indubitably, it *is* what's recommended.\n\nAlmost every Talent and Constellation is focused on creating Flat Energy, which means the damage multipliers are modest in comparison to Anemo and Geo Traveler. With Electro being the element that signifies energy, it is no wonder that Electro Traveler benefits greatly from Electro Resonance. Using Electro Traveler as a battery to its full capacity takes relatively little capital. Because an ER percent Main Stat on the Sands is the goal, and Substats don't matter much, the artifacts are fairly easy to harvest.\n\nFor different forms of playstyles, it is recommended to check out KQM's guide on the Electro Traveler!",
