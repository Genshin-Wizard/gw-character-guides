    "description": "Chongyun is a character who players will want to swap in and out of fields with frequently. His ability to assist other players in infusing cold energy may be highly beneficial, especially given how polearms like Xiangling and sword users like Keqing will play. Chongyun exposes the opponent to reactive harm while still being able to fight on his own.\n\nIn terms of playstyle, Chongyun falls in between Kaeya and Xingqiu. While they both utilize swords for quick assaults, Chongyun prefers more destructive Cryo hits while weaponizing the latter's summoned blades. With someone like Barbara on hand to inflict Wet on huge groups of foes, Chongyun may use his heavy-handed assaults to freeze and shatter them.",
