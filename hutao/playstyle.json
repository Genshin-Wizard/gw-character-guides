    "description": "Hu Tao is a powerful on-field DPS character who uses her Elemental Skill to sacrifice a portion of her current HP and gain a massive ATK boost proportional to her max HP.\n\nShe is best paired with a character that can apply a high volume of Hydro to enemies, such as Xingqiu or Yelan, which allows her to Vaporize all of her Charged Attacks for significant damage.\n\nShe should utilize N1Cs (one Normal Attack then Charged Attack) or N2Cs (two Normal Attacks then Charged Attack) and the Vaporize reaction in order to maximize her damage.",
