    "description": "Her playstyle is rather unusual; we haven't seen another character risk their own life in order to deal greater harm. Though she can recover herself to full health with her ult, this makes group play with her very difficult.\n\nShe should only have supports that increase her damage and not apply for any healing advantages. You'll have to become used to evading and managing your own HP bar as a Hu Tao main.\n\nCharacters such as Bennett and Mona, with their higher damage boost and melt damage, result in enormous crit numbers.",
