    "description": "Hu Tao is a powerful on-field DPS character who uses her Elemental Skill to sacrifice a portion of her current HP and gain a massive ATK boost proportional to her max HP.\n\nShe is best paired with a character that can apply a high volume of Hydro to enemies, such as Xingqiu or Yelan, which allows her to Vaporize all of her Charged Attacks for significant damage.\n\nShe should utilize N1Cs (one Normal Attack then Charged Attack) or N2Cs (two Normal Attacks then Charged Attack) and the Vaporize reaction in order to maximize her damage.\n\n**Cancels and Tech**\nCancelling refers to ending the animation of a character's attack early using a different action.\n\nHu Tao should Jump Cancel (J) or Dash Cancel (D) her Charged Attacks in single target situations for maximum damage output, as her Charged Attack animation is very long if allowed to play out fully (where she travels a short distance forward). Jump Cancels can help keep Hu Tao close to enemies to facilitate further attacks. Dash Cancels should only be used with C1 but can provide a significant damage increase. N1CD players should be aware there is a cooldown every two Dashes; using a Jump Cancel or waiting can remedy the issue. \n\nInstead of cancelling her final Charged Attack, she can use her Elemental Burst. This will extend her Elemental Skill\u2019s duration for her Elemental Burst\u2019s damage. \n \nNote that cancelling may not be the best option in scenarios with multiple targets as allowing the full Charged Attack animation to occur allows Hu Tao to hit multiple enemies in a straight line.\n\nFor more information on Hu Tao, check out the KQM guide linked below!",
