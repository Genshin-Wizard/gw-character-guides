    "description": "Hu Tao is a powerful on-field DPS character who uses her Elemental Skill to sacrifice a portion of her current HP and gain a massive ATK boost proportional to her max HP.\n\nShe is best paired with a character that can apply a high volume of Hydro to enemies, such as Xingqiu or Yelan, which allows her to Vaporize all of her Charged Attacks for significant damage.\n\nShe should utilize N1Cs (one Normal Attack then Charged Attack) or N2Cs (two Normal Attacks then Charged Attack) and the Vaporize reaction in order to maximize her damage.\n\n**Cancels and Tech**\nShe should Jump Cancel (J) or Dash Cancel (D) her Charged Attacks to be more effectively utilized. Jump Cancels can help keep Hu Tao close to enemies to facilitate further attacks. Dash Cancels should only be used with C1 but can provide a significant damage increase. N1CD players should be aware there is a cooldown every two Dashes; using a Jump Cancel or waiting can remedy the issue. \n\nInstead of cancelling her final Charged Attack, she can use her Elemental Burst. This will extend her Elemental Skill\u2019s duration for her Elemental Burst\u2019s damage. \n \n",
