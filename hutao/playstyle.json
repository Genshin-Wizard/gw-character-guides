    "description": "Her playstyle is rather unusual, risking her own life to deal greater harm. Although she can recover her health through her ult, keeping her alive can be challenging.\n\nHer teams should not opt-in for extreme healing, but instead focus on units that maximize her personal and team damage. Shielders such as Zhongli, Thoma, and Diona can be used to help with HP management. \n\nShe should utilize N1Cs (one Normal Attack then Charged Attack) or N2Cs (two Normal Attacks then Charged Attack) and the Vaporize reaction in order to maximize her damage.",
