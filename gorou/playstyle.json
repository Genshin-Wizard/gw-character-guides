    "description": "Gorou is most suited to supporting his teammates, since he enhances their defense and can even heal and augment geo crit damage at higher constellations. He has interruption resistance and can deliver significant damage, but he need geo players in your squad to properly utilize his powers, and his elemental burst has a large energy cost.\n\nThe following is a typical rotation for a Gorou team composition: \n> Using Goroou's Elemental Skill \n> Switching to your Geo carry character until you have enough energy to unleash Gorou's burst \n> Switching back to Gorou and using his Elemental Burst to enhance your team's Geo carriers \n> Repeat!",
