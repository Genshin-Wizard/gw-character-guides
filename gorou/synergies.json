    "description": "Gorou is a specialized support character, therefore you'll need to design your squad around his abilities. Because his Elemental Skill is most powerful when three Geo characters are present, you'll need a Geo DPS like Aratakki Itto in your party.\n\nAlong with him, another Geo support character like as Noelle, Zhongli, or Albedo will boost your team's overall efficiency. The fourth spot in your party will be adjustable according on the sort of adversaries you're battling, however an Elemental DPS or support is normally suggested.",
