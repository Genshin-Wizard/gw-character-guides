    "description": "**On-field Driver**\nUsing her relatively fast Normal Attacks and healing passives, Qiqi acts as the driver for a team with Fischl, Xingqiu and Beidou. This provides a large amount of healing and can maximize their Burst/Skill procs. It is very difficult to die as Qiqi, especially with her Elemental Skill and/or Elemental Burst up. \n*This is __not__ a Physical Qiqi build, but her Cryo application weak enough to not mess up Electrocharged will create Superconduct often enough to let her Ocean-Hued Clam bubbles deal extra damage. *\n**Off-field Healer**\nTap her Elemental Skill. If using Sacrificial Sword tap again when it ends, if not just wait. Her Elemental Skill spins around the active character, healing on one turn and applying Cryo on another. \nIt is difficult to get Qiqi\u2019s Elemental Burst up as she has no particle generated on her Elemental Skill and even with her first Constellation giving her a bit of energy, it\u2019s better to not expect her burst off-cooldown. If paired with her C6, it can be somewhat useful. She will generally heal more than enough from her Skill, but it can add even more healing. \n**Cryo Main DPS/Physical Main DPS**\nQiqi is not recommended to be built for cryo damage due to her hard to gain Elemental Burst and long downtime of Elemental Skill. Same with her Physical DPS build, her kit generally does not have high damaging scaling. *However, it\u2019s enough to clear the current endgame content with enough investment.*",
