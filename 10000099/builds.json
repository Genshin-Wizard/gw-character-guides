Its Energy restoration enables consistent Bursts with minimal ER% investment. \n\n__Calamity Queller__\nA strong option due to the huge amount of ATK it provides. To utilize this weapon’s passive, make sure to use Emilie’s Skill after casting her Burst.\n\n__Deathmatch__\nBattlepass weapon. Emilie’s best 4-star option. At higher refinements, it is capable of outperforming other 5-star Polearms.\n\n__Missive Windspear__\nMissive Windspear is Emilie’s best free weapon, but it was only available in the Version 3.1 Event."
