    "description": "Yumemikuzi Mizuki is an On-field healer and support who increases Swirl damage with off-field DPS, such as Fischl or Furina. Use all appropriate Elemental Bursts and Elemental Skills, then switch to Yumemikuzi Mizuki to swirl the applied elements. Due to her ability to heal, she is able to build fanfare for Furina. She can be played with another Anemo character, such as Vent, to increase their Swirl damage as well.\n\nYumemikuki Mizuki cannot be switched off during her Elemental Skill, which does most of her damage, nor can she perform Normal Attacks. This means that Beidou, Yelan, Xingqiu, etc’s Elemental Bursts do not synergize.",
