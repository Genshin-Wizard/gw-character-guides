    "description": "Venti can be fit into almost any squad, if not all, and his damage and grouping abilities allow him to trivialize content. However, his strength is severely limited in cases when his suction does not touch the adversary, a limitation that is more dependant on the type of enemy he faces than a handicap that can be compensated for by supports. Nonetheless, even at his weakest, he gives a lot of usefulness.\n\nThe Archon's skill set is best suited for Burst Support and Sub-DPS. Because he wields Anemo, he is an ideal ally for characters wielding Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro. This combo enhances the in-game Elemental Absorption mechanism, which may deal foes continual Elemental DMG.\n\nSkyward Sonnet, Venti's Elemental Skill, comes in two varieties. Tapping or pushing his E Skill summons a Wind Domain, which gives AoE Anemo DMG at the opponents' position. This may even propel minor opponents into the air, such as hilichurls and samachurls.\n\nHolding his E Skill, on the other hand, will summon a greater Wind Domain on Venti's position. As Venti floats into the air, nearby opponents will also deal AoE Anemo DMG. Holding this talent from his 1st Ascension Passive will also produce a 20-second upcurrent.\n\nThe upcurrent from Venti's E SKill is quite useful for creating a makeshift Xiao for diving assaults. You may also save some energy from ascending by doing this. This ability allows your team to move about for both fighting and exploration.",
