Drops ER requirements by ~80% at R5, enabling Heizou to use 2 Bursts per rotation instead of 1 Burst per rotation for some extra peesonal damage and CC. \n\n__Favonius Codex__ \nA strong option on Heizou as he can proc the passive once or twice per rotation, dropping team ER requirements significantly when afforded the CRIT Rate substats needed to proc the passive more consistently.

( mono anemo/ geo, secondary VV holder already in team, etc )\n\nfor mono anemo/ geo element teams, running a crit build would be much preferred for his personal damage. "
