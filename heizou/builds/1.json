Since the weapon passive limits the flexibility of rotations in order to be more optimally utilised, it is most advisable to run this weapon when playing an already rotation-strict team. \n** **"

            "value": "__Solar Pearl (DPS)__\nA strong weapon with an equally good passive that, as a whole, works well with Heizou\u2019s kit.\n\n__Widsith (DPS)__\nIn quickswap, Widsith at high refinements has the ability to outperform Atlas/ Kagura\u2019s Verity when its passive procs. However, due to the 30s cooldown, those weapons will still be better overall when factoring multiple rotations. \n\n__Mappa Mare (DPS)__ \nNot the strongest but still a decent F2P option should none of the gacha weapons be available to the player. \n\n__Prototype Amber (Support)__ \nPrototype Amber has the unique ability that aids teams without a healer with its micro-heals. Its passive also helps to reduce ER requirements significantly, which is best utilized in teams where he can only get off one skill use with each burst; although the value of this greatly depends on if the player has his C4 already as it provides a large reduction to his energy needs.\n** **"
