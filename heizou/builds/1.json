In teams that already have an anemo running the 4-piece effect or mono ge/ anemo team compositions, running 2-piece set combinations on Heizou is an option. \n\nWhen playing Heizou in Electrocharge team compositions as an on-field driver, 4VV + Elemental Mastery mainstats and substats can be preferred for its consistent multi-target damage; opting to focus on his swirls and electrocharge ownership to make up the bulk of his personal damage instead of his talent multipliers. For such a build in electrocharge team compositions, __refer to the Burst/ Support Heizou build guide__ as the weapon options/ substat priority are more applicable. "
