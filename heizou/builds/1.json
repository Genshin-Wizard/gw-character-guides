Since the weapon passive limits the flexibility of rotations in order to be more optimally utilised, it is most advisable to run this weapon when playing an already rotation-strict team. \n** **"

For those without the liberty of catalyst options, using a billet to craft the Mappa Mare for Heizou is a very solid course of action.  \n\n\n__Solar Pearl (DPS)__\nA decent weapon with a passive that, as a whole, works well with Heizou\u2019s kit. However, it is not advisable to purchase the battle pass purely because Mappa Mare performs similarly while being a completely free option. \n\n__Prototype Amber (Support)__ \nPrototype Amber has a unique ability that aids healer-less teams with its micro-heals. The weapon passive also helps to reduce ER requirements significantly, which is best utilized in teams where he can only get off one skill use per burst; although the value greatly depends on if the player has his C4, which already provides a large reduction to his energy needs.\n** **"

In this scenario, a range of 110-120% ER should be enough to burst every rotation. \nFor more specific situations, be sure to check out the Energy Recharge Calculator tool.\n\n4 Viridescent Venerer is the best artifact set by far for Heizou. In teams that already have an anemo running the 4-piece set or monogeo/ anemo team compositions, running 2-piece set combinations on Heizou is an option. "
