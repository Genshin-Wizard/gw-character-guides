However, owing to the 30s buff trigger cooldown, 5 star options still pull ahead when the note buffs are averaged. \n\n__Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers (Support)__\nSince the weapon passive limits the flexibility of rotations in order to utlise its strong single-character buff, players are encouraged to run this weapon only when playing an already rotation-strict team. \n** **"

            "value": "__Mappa Mare (DPS)__ \nA surprisingly strong weapon that is competitive with the other 4 star options, in addition to having an easy to maintain weapon passive. For those without the liberty of catalyst options, using a billet to craft the Mappa Mare for Heizou is a very solid course of action.  \n\n\n__Solar Pearl (DPS)__\nA decent weapon with a passive that, as a whole, works well with Heizou\u2019s kit. However, it is not advisable to purchase the battle pass purely because Mappa Mare performs similarly while being a completely free option. \n\n__Prototype Amber (Support)__ \nPrototype Amber has a unique ability that aids healer-less teams with its micro-heals in addition to managing his ER requirements when Heizou can only get off one skill use per burst. However, it should be noted the the value of the energy weapon passive greatly depends on if the player has his C4, which already provides a large reduction to his ER requirements.\n** **"

In this scenario, a range of 110-120% ER should be enough to burst every rotation. \nFor more specific situations, be sure to check out the Energy Recharge Calculator tool.\n\n4 Viridescent Venerer is the best artifact set by far for Heizou. In teams that already have an anemo running the 4-piece set or monogeo/ anemo team compositions, running 2-piece set combinations on Heizou is an option. "
