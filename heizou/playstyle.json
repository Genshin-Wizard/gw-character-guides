    "description": "Heizou is a unique character, one of few in the game that can be considered an *enabler carry*. Although his personal damage is passable, his true power lies in his ability to carry 4-piece Viridescent Venerer, by virtue of being an Anemo character.\n\nSince he relies on triggering elemental reactions to build up Declension stacks to increase the power of his Elemental Skill, Heizou is best paired with off-field elemental applicators such as Yelan, Xingqiu, Fischl or Xiangling.\n\nAs 4-piece Viridescent Venerer is an extremely powerful damage amplifier for the elements swirled by Heizou, he effectively enables the damage of the other characters in his team.",
