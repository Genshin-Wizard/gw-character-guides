    "description": "Heizou is a unique character due to the sheer versatility afforded to him by his kit. His high scalings, minor grouping, good rate of anemo application, effectiveness as a 4VV holder, a4 providing an EM boost, and capability to use both offensive and supportive weapon options allows Heizou to be a very versatile character; with his kit being largely beneficial to a variety of team compositions.\n\nAs an __On-Field EM Carry__, Heizou utilizes 4VV and his quick normals to effectively proc Off-Field units like Beidou, Yelan, Fischl, and Xingqiu while offering strong personal damage through swirls and the reactions they chain, such as electrocharged.\n\nAs a __Quickswap DPS/Support__, Heizou provides an EM buff from his A4 while holding the 4VV set. He maintains his personal damage through his fully stacked Elemental Skill with a crit build. His low field time in this playstyle allows for other more field-time-heavy units make use of both his buffs, and utility as a support while Heizou himself provides his own share of personal damage.
