    "description": "Heizou is a unique character due to the sheer versatility afforded to him by his kit. His high scalings, minor grouping, good rate of anemo application, effective 4VV holder, a4 providing an EM boost, and capability to use both offensive and supportive weapon options allows Heizou to be used in a variety of situations. \n\nAs an On-Field EM Carry, Heizou utilizes 4VV and his quick normals to effectively proc Off-Field units like Beidou, Yelan, Fischl, and Xingqiu while offering strong personal damage through swirls and the chain reactions they cause, such as electrocharged. \n\nAs a Quickswap DPS/Support, Heizou provides his EM buff and holds the 4VV set while maintaining personal damage through his fully stacked Elemental Skill when running a crit build. His strong buff potential and low field time in this playstyle allows other more field time-heavy units make use of his buffs and utility as a support. ",
