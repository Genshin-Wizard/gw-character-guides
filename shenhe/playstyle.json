    "description": "Shenhe works best as a Cryo support who increases your team's DMG. She may, however, be used as a pure ATK Sub-DPS. Spring Spirit Summoning, her Elemental Skill, has two modes: fast push and hold. When used, the Icy Quill effect is applied to all adjacent party members. The Cryo DMG dealt by the Skill is determined on the mode you select.\n\nIf you push to use the Elemental Skill, Shenhe runs ahead and uses a Talisman Spirit to deal Cryo DMG to opponents in her route. Shenhe's Talisman Spirit, on the other hand, delivers Cryo DMG if you hold down on the Skill.\n\nBased on Shenhe's current ATK, the Icy Quill effect enhances the Cryo DMG of Normal, Charged, Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skill and Bursts. When you press the skill, the bonus lasts 10 seconds and 15 seconds when you hold it down.",
