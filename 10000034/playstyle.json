    "description": "The Normal Talent priority is:\n> Noelle's Normal Attack (NA)\n> Noelle's Elemental Burst (Q)\n> Noelle's Elemental Skill (E)\n\nYou can begin transitioning from an ATK build to a DEF build (running a DEF timepiece instead of an ATK timepiece) at Burst Talent 9+ or with C6. Her Skill does not need to be raised, however it is great to have a little extra shielding and healing. It should be noted that raising up her Skill does not enhance her C4 damage.",
