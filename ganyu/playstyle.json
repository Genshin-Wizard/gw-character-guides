    "description": "Because of their 'repetitive' battle style of standing back and repeating aim shot from a distance, these gamers have received a lot of criticism.\n\nDespite the fact that the majority of their damage comes from using aim shot damage and increasing DPS from a distance, this character can still solo carry 4 person domains.\n\nWhen utilizing the Amos' bow, standing at a distance is critical. While you still want to use your other abilities, your ice Lotus functions as an AOE taunt that lures players in and lets you a sprint backwards to put more gap between you and them.",
