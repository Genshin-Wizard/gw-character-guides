Due to a lower Base Attack, Ganyu\u2019s damage will scale slightly better with Shenhe\u2019s Elemental Skill buff and Bennett\u2019s Elemental Burst Flat Attack buff.\n\n__Prototype Crescent R5__\nAssuming she can hit a weakpoint, this bow is competitive with her 5* bows.\n\n__Amos\u2019 Bow__\nProvides an enormous amount of DMG% bonus to Charged Attacks. Any team compositions that use them will find Amos\u2019 Bow very effective. However, a significant amount of Freeze DPS Ganyu\u2019s damage is her Elemental Burst, which it does not buff.\n\n**Early Game Option:**\n__Sharpshooter's Oath__\nHits in weakspots are guaranteed to CRIT. Thus, no CRIT Rate is necessary if you're an aim god."

            "value": "__Thundering Pulse__\nExcellent unconditional weapon for DPS capability. Its passive is largely wasted due to it providing Normal Attack DMG.\n\n__Polar Star__\nConditionally excellent if Ganyu fully stacks its passive by weaving in a Normal Attack before her DPS window (ie. N1EQC+). Will go over 100% CRIT Rate against Frozen enemies with 4pc Blizzard Strayer and Cryo Resonance, thus losing value.\n\n__Skyward Harp__\nGreat unconditional damage option. The CRIT Rate stat is not ideal, as it raises the likelihood that Ganyu goes over 100% CRIT Rate with artifact substats against frozen enemies.\n\nMounn\u2019s Moon, The Viridescent Hunt, Blackcliff Warbow and Hamayumi R5 are all very viable.\n"
