She will also enter the Manifest Gale state. \nWhile in the Manifest Gale state, Faruzan's next fully charged shot will consume this state and will become a Hurricane Arrow that contains high-pressure currents. This arrow deals Anemo DMG based on the DMG of a fully charged Aimed Shot from 'Normal Attack: Turnaround Shooter.' \n**Pressurized Collapse** \nThe Hurricane Arrow will apply a Pressurized Collapse effect to the opponent or character hit. This effect will be removed after a short delay, creating a vortex that deals AoE Anemo DMG and pulls nearby objects and opponents in. If the Hurricane Arrow does not hit any opponent or character, it will create a Pressurized Collapse effect at its point of impact. \nThe vortex DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG."

Once it reaches each corner of that triangular path, it will unleash 1 more Whirlwind Pulse. \n**Whirlwind Pulse*\n>·When the Whirlwind Pulse hits opponents, it will apply Perfidious Wind's Ruin to them, decreasing their Anemo RES.\n>·The Whirlwind Pulse will also apply Prayerful Wind's Gift to all party members when it is unleashed, granting them Anemo DMG Bonus."
