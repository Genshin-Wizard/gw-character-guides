    "description": "You may combine Cryo with Pyro to attack and generate the Melt response since it is an element that strikes the proper balance between offensive and support. Similarly, you may utilize it in conjunction with Electro to help generate the Superconduct reaction. In such instances, Diona is an irresistible match in Genshin Impact. Diona typically has two playstyles: support (which is more common) and on-field DPS.\n\n**Support (popular)**: \n> This is a very easy playstyle that consists of completing one or two Hold Elemental Skills, Bursting, and then switching to another character.\n\n**On-field DPS (not recommended)**:\n> The majority of these teams rely on off-field DPSes to perform the majority of the damage. Melt Diona is unable to function owing to Diona's ICD, a mechanism that limits the frequency of elemental reactions. This guide will not cover these teams.",
