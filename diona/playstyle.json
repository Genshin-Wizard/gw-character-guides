    "description": "Diona is a versatile and simple to play support with healing and shielding capabilities. \n\nShe is cheap to build but offers versatility in how she can support a team due to strong shielding and producing many cryo particles on her Hold Skill, and decent healing on her Burst.\n\nThis makes her a comfortable flex option on many teams. Her main uses are as a battery in freeze teams and as a shielder in other teams, in both cases it is recommended to use her Hold Skill. Her playstyle is extremely simple to play and typically consists of doing one or two Hold Skills, Bursting, and then swapping off to another character.",
