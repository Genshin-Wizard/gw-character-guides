    "description": "Her playstyle as a sub DPS is rather straightforward. When your burst timer expires, switch to her, use your elemental skill to add the Phys Damage boost and shred opponent resistance if you have her C4, then burst and swap back. If you want to maximize your burst damage, especially if you have C6, conduct a spin combination after you burst before returning to your primary DPS. If you try to spin before exploding with her C6, the damage bonus will not carry over because it finishes as soon as you stop spinning.",
