If you need to pick a Battle Pass weapon for Cyno, pick this.\n\n__White Tassel R5__ \nExcellent low investment, F2P weapon choice for Cyno owing to the large, uncoditional NA DMG% and crit rate mainstat it has — even with its notably low base attack. \n\n__Kitain Cross Spear__\nConsider in Quickbloom teams. Good craftable option."

( With the exception of aesthetics )\n\n__Missive Windspear R5__\nEvent weapon that — although viable — does not perform better than the already impressive and mostly uncontested White Tassel R5. Only consider upgrading if the player had foddered their White Tassel. \n** **"

Generally, low base attacks prefer EM sands while high base attack weapons would prefer ATK sands. \n\n__ER Requirements?__\nSolo Electro ~ 160-180%+\nDouble Electro ( Fischl ) ~ 100-120% \nDouble Electro ( non-Fischl ) ~ 120-150%\n*ER requirements assume 1 favonius proc; 4 TF lowers ER requirements further* \n\n__Regarding 4 Thundering Fury…__\nWorks well for Cyno — both to lower ER requirements and increase personal damage — but restricts users to a fixed combo as the reduction in E CD can be more detrimental than helpful. ( owing to missing Endseer timings )\nFor most, it is more recommended to ditch 4 Thundering Fury on Cyno unless confident in executing the specific combos.\n\n__Marechaussee Hunter__\nOnly with Furina, a quickbloom team with this set is viable."
