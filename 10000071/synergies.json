Examples being: **Fischl**, **Kuki**, **Beidou**, **Yae**, and **Dori**.\n\nDendro being a novelty means **Dendro flexes** are scarce. Thankfully, between the characters readily available, Cyno is able to synergize with both the **Dendro Traveler** and **Collei**, which are **free units**.\n\n**Hydro flexes** include **Xingqiu**, **Yelan**, **Kokomi** and **Barbara**.\n\n**Anemo flexes** can be picked up for their Grouping/Buffing/Healing capabilities—**Kazuha**, **Sucrose**, **Heizou**, **Sayu**, **Jean**, **Anemo Traveler**."
