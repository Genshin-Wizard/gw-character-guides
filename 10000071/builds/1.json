( With the exception of aesthetics )\n\n__Missive Windspear R5__\nEvent weapon that \u2014 although viable \u2014 does not perform better than the already impressive and mostly uncontested White Tassel R5. Only consider upgrading if the player had foddered their White Tassel. \n** **"

( owing to missing Endseer timings )\nFor most, it is more recommended to ditch 4 Thundering Fury on Cyno unless confident in executing the specific combos."
